# React-Social-Network-Prototype
A prototype of a social network, currently under development. This project serves as a hands-on practice to improve my React skills, following various tutorials. It will be refactored and improved as I learn new concepts, but for now, it represents my progress up to this point.

## Technologies
- React
- CSS modules

## Features
- Component-based SPA
- Grid CSS layout using modules
- Routers and NavLinks
- No Redux for now, but there is a BLL layer (a file to separate the data from UI)
- Data is transformed with props and mapped inside components

## Goals
- Adaptive and responsive design for better platform support
- Implement Redux for state management
- Replace temporary flashy design with an aesthetically pleasing UI
- Use React hooks where applicable to improve performance
- Implement user authentication
- Refactor components to make them more reusable
- Make core features reactive (user posts, comments, and likes)
